# 🤔 What is Mission 2.exe?
Mission 2 is a GDI malware made by Venra that may potentially make your ears bleed.

# 🦠 Features
Mission 2 can exploit vulnerabilities in the Windows Graphics Device Interface to display a mesmerizing effect on the screen.


# ❤️ For Skidders
This one is mainly for you, N17Pro3426 and FedouM. If you plan to use its source code, I added the GPL-3.0 licence, so if you skid, you must release the source code of your project.
